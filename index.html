    <p class="Meow">The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, 
        is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology
         and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East
          around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges 
          freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship
           and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws it is adapted to killing
            small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, 
            and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.</p>
